Time
It needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there
I will be there
Fight
Babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can bring down the wall someday
I will be there
I will be there
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you
Try
Baby, try
To trust in my love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there
I will be there
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know
What you've been through
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
Still loving you, baby
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
I need your love
Hoo!
I'm still loving you
I need your love
Hoo!
I need your love
